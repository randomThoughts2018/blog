Hi, thanks for stopping by. I am Vineet Singh, computer scientist by training and software developer by profession. At core I am technologist with strong inclination toward making products that change people's lives. I *officially* work in field of ```cryptocurrencies``` e.g. Bitcoin. I work with ```Citi Innovation Labs```, here in Dublin. At Citi, I am part of a team that provides actionable strategic directions in financial technology space to Citi Execs. I am also part of the ```Blockchain engineering team```. When I am not fixing solidity smart contract bugs, I train neural networks on structured real world data.

This blog is a log of my:

* Current understanding of ```disruptive technologies``` gained by:
    * Re-implementing SOTA results from scratch in case of ```machine learning```. 
    * ```Designing products``` with the help of data science as well as ```distributed transactional platforms```. 
    * ```Innovation and design theory```, what works and what doesn't. 
    * My unique path to learning ```React``` and ```d3```.
